Automatic Debian Video Downloader


Just a very simple script to make video downloading for linux much easier. Providing you with options for quality and format.
Also, gives you an option to convert your videos to mp3.

Still a very buggy build so in-case email me at "emmetcooper@hotmail.com"

This script uses:
ffmpeg
youtube-dl
aptitude

Don't worry. The script will do the download for you.

This script is coded on:
Debian 3.7.2-0 i686 GNU/Linux

It would be awesome if you'll provide multi-distro support. ;)
